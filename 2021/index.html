        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>You are invited to participate in the <strong>2nd Workshop on Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE2021)</strong>, to be held as part of the <span class="jcdl">ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2021</span>, September 27-30, 2021, Online (Due to the Global Pandemic)</p>
        <p><a href="https://eeke-workshop.github.io/2021">https://eeke-workshop.github.io/2021</a></p>
        <p> </p>
        <h2>Aim of the Workshop</h2>
        <p align="justify">In the era of big data, massive amounts of  information and data have   dramatically changed human civilization. The broad availability  of   information provides more opportunities for people, but there has   appeared a  new challenge: how can we obtain useful knowledge from   numerous information sources. A  knowledge entity is a relatively independent and integral   knowledge module in a  special discipline or a research domain [1]. As a   crucial medium for  knowledge transmission, scientific documents that   contain a large number of  knowledge entities attract the attention of   scholars [2]. In  scientific documents, knowledge entities refer to the   knowledge mentioned or  cited by authors, such as algorithms, models,   theories, datasets and software,  which reflect the various resources   used by the authors in solving problems.  Extracting knowledge entities   from scientific documents in an accurate and  comprehensive way becomes a   significant topic. We may recommend documents  related to a given   knowledge entity (e.g. LSTM model) for scholars, especially for    beginners in a research field. DARPA has recently launched the ASKE   (Automating  Scientific Knowledge Extraction) project [3], which aims to   develop  next-generation applications of artificial intelligence. <br>
          Therefore,  the goal of this workshop is to engage the related   communities in open problems  in the extraction and evaluation of   knowledge entities from scientific  documents.  At present, scholars have used knowledge  entities to construct general   knowledge-graphs [4] and domain knowledge-graphs [5].  Data sources for   these studies include text (news, policy files, email, etc.)  and   multimedia (video, image, etc.) data. Compared to existing research and    workshops like Joint workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information   Retrieval  and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries   (BIRNDL) [6] or  Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications (WOSP) [7],   this workshop aims to  extract knowledge entities from scientific   documents, and explore the feature  of entities to conduct practical   applications. The results of this workshop are  expected to provide   scholars, especially early career researchers, with  knowledge   recommendations and other knowledge entity-based services. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <h2>Workshop Topics</h2>
        <p>This      workshop will be relevant to scholars in computer and information     science,  specialized in Information Extraction, Text Mining, NLP, IR     and Digital  Libraries. It will also be of importance for all     stakeholders in the  publication pipeline: implementers, publishers and     policymakers.    This workshop entitles this cutting-edge and  cross-disciplinary direction <em>Extraction  and Evaluation of Knowledge Entity</em>,    highlighting the development of  intelligent methods for identifying     knowledge claims in scientific documents,  and promoting the application    of knowledge entities. We invite stimulating  research on topics     including, but not limited to, methods of knowledge entity  extraction     and applications of knowledge entity. Specific examples of fields of    interest include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extraction knowledge and entity from scientific documents</li>
          <li>Model  and algorithmize entity extraction from scientific documents </li>
          <li>Dataset  and metrics mention extraction from scientific documents </li>
          <li>Software  and tool extraction from scientific documents [8] </li>
          <li>Construction  of a knowledge entity graph and roadmap [9]</li>
          <li>Knowledge  entity summarization </li>
          <li>Relation  extraction of knowledge entity </li>
          <li>Construction  of a knowledge base of knowledge entities</li>
          <li>Bibliometrics  of knowledge entity</li>
          <li>Evaluation of knowledge entity in the scientific documents</li>

        <h5 align="left"><strong>2nd Keynote</strong>: <strong>Entity Summarization: Where We Are and What Lies Ahead?</strong></h5>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Semantic data such as knowledge graphs, describing entities with  property values, are increasingly available on the Web. A large number of  property values describing an entity may overload users with excessive amounts  of information. One solution is to generate a summary (e.g., a small subset of  key property values) for entity descriptions to satisfy users' information  needs efficiently and effectively. This research topic, termed Entity  Summarization, has received considerable attention in the past decade. In this  talk, I will review existing methods and evaluation efforts on entity  summarization. I will categorize existing methods by presenting a hierarchy of  technical features that have been incorporated, including generic,  domain-specific, and task-specific features. I will show various frameworks for  combining multiple features to assemble a full entity summarizer, including  graph-based models, grouping, re-ranking, and combinatorial optimization. I  will particularly highlight some pioneering deep learning based methods.  Finally, I will discuss limitations of existing methods and, based on that, I  will suggest several directions for future research.</p>

        <h2>Submission Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Regular papers</strong>: All submissions must be written in English, following the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Proceedings template</a> (10 pages for <strong>full papers</strong> and 4 pages for <strong>short papers</strong> exclusive of unlimited pages for references) and should be submitted as PDF files to <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=eeke2021">EasyChair</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Poster &amp; demonstration</strong>: We welcome submissions     detailing original, early findings, works in progress and industrial     applications of knowledge entities extraction ande evaluation for a     special poster session, possibly with a 2-minute presentation in the     main session. Some research track papers will also be invited to the     poster track instead, although there will be no difference in the final     proceedings between poster and research track submissions. These   papers   should follow the same format as the research track papers but   can be   shorter (2 pages for <strong>poster and demo papers</strong>).</p>
        <h3> <span style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=eeke2021" target="_new">Submit a paper</a></span></h3>
        <p> All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent  reviewers. <strong>Please   be aware of the fact that at least   one author per paper needs to   register for the workshop and   attend the workshop to present the work.</strong> In case of no-show   the paper (even if accepted) will be deleted from the   proceedings and from the program. </p>
        <p>Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop     proceedings publication service. This way the  proceedings will be   permanently available and citable (digital   persistent identifiers and   long term preservation).</p>
