        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>You are invited to participate in the <strong>2nd Workshop on Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE2021)</strong>, to be held as part of the <span class="jcdl">ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2021</span>, September 27-30, 2021, Online (Due to the Global Pandemic)</p>
        <p><a href="https://eeke-workshop.github.io/2021">https://eeke-workshop.github.io/2021</a></p>
        <p> </p>
        <h2>Aim of the Workshop</h2>
        <p align="justify">In the era of big data, massive amounts of  information and data have   dramatically changed human civilization. The broad availability  of   information provides more opportunities for people, but there has   appeared a  new challenge: how can we obtain useful knowledge from   numerous information sources. A  knowledge entity is a relatively independent and integral   knowledge module in a  special discipline or a research domain [1]. As a   crucial medium for  knowledge transmission, scientific documents that   contain a large number of  knowledge entities attract the attention of   scholars [2]. In  scientific documents, knowledge entities refer to the   knowledge mentioned or  cited by authors, such as algorithms, models,   theories, datasets and software,  which reflect the various resources   used by the authors in solving problems.  Extracting knowledge entities   from scientific documents in an accurate and  comprehensive way becomes a   significant topic. We may recommend documents  related to a given   knowledge entity (e.g. LSTM model) for scholars, especially for    beginners in a research field. DARPA has recently launched the ASKE   (Automating  Scientific Knowledge Extraction) project [3], which aims to   develop  next-generation applications of artificial intelligence. <br>
          Therefore,  the goal of this workshop is to engage the related   communities in open problems  in the extraction and evaluation of   knowledge entities from scientific  documents.  At present, scholars have used knowledge  entities to construct general   knowledge-graphs [4] and domain knowledge-graphs [5].  Data sources for   these studies include text (news, policy files, email, etc.)  and   multimedia (video, image, etc.) data. Compared to existing research and    workshops like Joint workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information   Retrieval  and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries   (BIRNDL) [6] or  Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications (WOSP) [7],   this workshop aims to  extract knowledge entities from scientific   documents, and explore the feature  of entities to conduct practical   applications. The results of this workshop are  expected to provide   scholars, especially early career researchers, with  knowledge   recommendations and other knowledge entity-based services. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <h2>Workshop Topics</h2>
        <p>This      workshop will be relevant to scholars in computer and information     science,  specialized in Information Extraction, Text Mining, NLP, IR     and Digital  Libraries. It will also be of importance for all     stakeholders in the  publication pipeline: implementers, publishers and     policymakers.    This workshop entitles this cutting-edge and  cross-disciplinary direction <em>Extraction  and Evaluation of Knowledge Entity</em>,    highlighting the development of  intelligent methods for identifying     knowledge claims in scientific documents,  and promoting the application    of knowledge entities. We invite stimulating  research on topics     including, but not limited to, methods of knowledge entity  extraction     and applications of knowledge entity. Specific examples of fields of    interest include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extraction knowledge and entity from scientific documents</li>
          <li>Model  and algorithmize entity extraction from scientific documents </li>
          <li>Dataset  and metrics mention extraction from scientific documents </li>
          <li>Software  and tool extraction from scientific documents [8] </li>

        <h2>Programme</h2>
        <h5 align="left"><strong>1st Keynote: From Wikis to Knowledge Graphs: Approaches and Challenges beyond DBpedia and YAGO</strong></h5>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Wikipedia was among the first sources to be identified for automatic knowledge graph construction. DBpedia and YAGO, two of the most widely used public knowledge graphs, perform knowledge extraction from Wikipedia by following the "one entity per Wiki page" paradigm. Thus, the resulting graphs are naturally limited by the coverage of Wikipedia, and they inherit many biases from it. In my talk, I will introduce recent alternatives for creating knowledge graphs from Wikis, in particular DBkWik and CaLiGraph, which use different approaches for identifying entities, and I will point out several challenges that exist off the beaten path of the "one entity per Wiki page" approaches.        </p>
         <p align="justify"><img src="images/Heiko Paulheim.jpg" class="u-pull-left" width="165" height="192" align="left">Dr. <span class="keynote">Heiko Paulheim</span> is a professor for Data Science at the University of Mannheim, Germany. His research focuses on the construction and usage of large-scale knowledge graphs. He explores methods for generating those knowledge graphs from various sources (such as Wikis and other structured Web sites or parts thereof), as well as techniques for automatically refining those graphs by inferring missing knowledge or finding errors by means of heuristic inference or machine learning. Moreover, he takes a holistic view on knowledge graph construction and refinement by trying to explicate and leverage meta-knowledge on the knowledge construction process and lifecycle. From an application perspective, he analyses and explores the usage of knowledge graphs to improve the performance of different knowledge-intensive tasks. Here, he has developed methods for exploiting public knowledge graphs as background knowledge in data mining tasks, both using symbolic and subsymbolic methods, most notably RDF2vec. Heiko holds a PhD from the Technical University of Darmstadt.</span> (<a href="http://www.heikopaulheim.com/">http://www.heikopaulheim.com/</a>)</p>
        

        <h5 align="left"><strong>2nd Keynote: Entity Summarization: Where We Are and What Lies Ahead?</strong></h5>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Semantic data such as knowledge graphs, describing entities with  property values, are increasingly available on the Web. A large number of  property values describing an entity may overload users with excessive amounts  of information. One solution is to generate a summary (e.g., a small subset of  key property values) for entity descriptions to satisfy users' information  needs efficiently and effectively. This research topic, termed Entity  Summarization, has received considerable attention in the past decade. In this  talk, I will review existing methods and evaluation efforts on entity  summarization. I will categorize existing methods by presenting a hierarchy of  technical features that have been incorporated, including generic,  domain-specific, and task-specific features. I will show various frameworks for  combining multiple features to assemble a full entity summarizer, including  graph-based models, grouping, re-ranking, and combinatorial optimization. I  will particularly highlight some pioneering deep learning based methods.  Finally, I will discuss limitations of existing methods and, based on that, I  will suggest several directions for future research.</p>
