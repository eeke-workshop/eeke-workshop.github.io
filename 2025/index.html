      <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>You are invited to participate in the <strong>Joint Workshop of the 5th AI + Informetrics (AII) and the 6th Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE): AII-EEKE 2025</strong> to be held as part of the ISSI2025, Yerevan, Armenia, June 23-27, 2025</p>
        <p><a href="https://eeke-workshop.github.io/2025">https://eeke-workshop.github.io/2025</a></p>
      <h2>Aim of the Workshop</h2>
        <p>Artificial  intelligence (AI), particularly the increasing success of large language models  (LLMs), is revolutionizing the research paradigm of scientometrics and  informetrics, highlighting its incredible capabilities in scalable, effective,  robust, and adaptable data analytics. AI-empowered informetric models have  achieved significant accomplishments in the context of scientometric studies,  e.g., supporting the design of scientometric research with insights,  communicating the community by combining computational models and human  knowledge, and developing adaptable analytical tools for deep literature  analysis. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>AI + Informetrics (AII) Workshop</strong> series emphasizes endeavors in connecting  AI and informetrics by constructing fundamental theories, developing novel  methodologies, bridging conceptual knowledge with practical uses, and creating  real-word solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As  one of the fundamental tasks in scientometrics, extracting useful knowledge  entities from massive scientific data has been a long interest of the  community, while the exponentially increased data volume and modality, the  complicated real-world context of diverse knowledge entities, and the  adaptability of rapidly developing AI techniques to actual information retrieval scenarios further  obstacle a comprehensive solution. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entity (EEKE) Workshop </strong>series  highlights the development of intelligent methods for identifying knowledge  entities from scientific documents and promoting their application in broad  information studies. </li>
        </ul>
<p>This  joint workshop aims to engage the scientometrics community with broad open  problems in AII and EEKE, foster interactive applications in the context of  scientometrics, and gather researchers and practical users to open a  collaborative platform for exchanging ideas, sharing pilot studies, and scoping  future directions on this cutting-edge venue. We highlight the following core  objectives:</p>
<ul>
          <li>Cohering AII-EEKE to fulfill  cross-disciplinary gaps from either theoretical or practical perspectives</li>
          <li>Developing advanced AII-EEKE models  with enhanced capabilities in robustness, adaptability, and effectiveness.</li>
          <li>Leveraging  knowledge, concepts, and models in information management to strengthen the  interpretability of AII-EEKE to adapt to empirical needs in real-world cases.</li>
</ul>
        <p> </p>
      <h2>Workshop Topics</h2>
<p>This workshop is primarily designed for academic researchers in broad information and library sciences, science of science, artificial intelligence, and will also be of interest to librarians, ST&amp;I administrators and policymakers, and practitioners in any related sectors.

        <h5 align="left"><strong>Keynote:&nbsp; Large Language Models for Research Quality Evaluation: Technical Challenges</strong><em><span class="text"><strong><a href="slides/keynote.pptx"><img src="images/PPT.png" alt="" width="18" height="18" border="0"/></a></strong> <a href="slides/"> </a></span></h5>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp;Although different studies have shown that ChatGPT 4o, ChatGPT 4o-mini and Gemini 1.5 Flash have a moderate ability to estimate the quality of academic research, there are many technical challenges with researching the value of Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task. These challenges include the amount of resources (money or computing power and specialist equipment) to conduct large scale experiments, the time taken to run some tests, and the likely continued evolution of LLMs and the emergence of new ones. These all reduce the ability of researchers to compare models and strategies, compared to pre-LLM artificial intelligence studies. This talk will discuss these issues and ask questions about the expectations that are reasonable for this type of research. </p>
        <p align="justify"><img src="images/Mike-Thelwall-3-225x300.jpg" class="u-pull-left" width="165" height="192" align="left"> Mike Thelwall is a Professor of Data Science in the Information School at the University of Sheffield in the UK. He primarily investigates quantitative methods to support research evaluation, including artificial intelligence, citation analysis and altmetrics.
