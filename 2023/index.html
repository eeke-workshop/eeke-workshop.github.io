      <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>You are invited to participate in the <strong>Joint Workshop of the 4th Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entities from Scientific Documents (EEKE2023) and the 3rd AI + Informetrics (AII2023)</strong>, to be held as part of the <span class="jcdl">ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2023</span>, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, June 26 - 30, 2023</p>

      <h2>Aim of the Workshop</h2>
        <p align="justify">In the era of big data, massive amounts of information and data have dramatically changed human civilization. The broad availability of information provides more opportunities for people, but a new challenge is rising: how can we obtain useful knowledge from numerous information sources. A knowledge entity is a relatively independent and integral knowledge module in a special discipline or a research domain [1]. As a crucial medium for knowledge transmission, scientific documents that contain a large number of knowledge entities attract the attention of scholars [2]. Complementarily, informetrics, known as the study of quantitative aspects of information, has gained great benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), with its capacities in analyzing unstructured scalable data and streams, understanding uncertain semantics, and developing robust and repeatable models. Incorporating informetrics with AI techniques has demonstrated enormous success in turning big data into big value and impact. For example, deep learning approaches enlighten studies of pattern recognition  and further leverage time series to track technological change. However, how to effectively cohere the power of AI and informetrics to create cross-disciplinary solutions is still elusive from neither theoretical nor practical perspectives.</p>
        <p>This workshop aims to engage related communities in open problems in the extraction and evaluation of knowledge entities from scientific documents and AI + Informetrics. Specifically, knowledge entities in scientific documents may include method entities, tasks, dataset and metrics, software and tools, etc [3]. Knowledge entity application includes the construction of a knowledge entity graph and roadmap, modeling functions of knowledge entity citations, etc. There are some online platforms based on knowledge entities, e.g., SAGE Research Methods and  &lsquo;SOTA&rsquo; project. In parallel, this workshop also targets certain unsolved issues in AI + Informetrics and a wide range of its practical scenarios including: Cohering AI and informetrics to fulfill cross-disciplinary gaps from either theoretical or practical perspectives; elaborating AI-empowered informetric models with enhanced capabilities in robustness, adaptability, and effectiveness, and leveraging knowledge, concepts, and models in information management to strengthen the interpretability of AI + Informetrics to adapt to empirical needs in real-world cases [4]. <br>
          This joint workshop entitles these two cutting-edge and cross-disciplinary directions as:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Extraction and Evaluation of Knowledge Entity (EEKE)</strong>, highlighting the development of intelligent methods for identifying knowledge entities from scientific documents, and promoting their application in broad information studies. </li>
          <li><strong>AI + Informetrics (AII)</strong>, emphasizing endeavors in interacting AI and informetrics by constructing fundamental theories, developing novel methodologies, bridging conceptual knowledge with practical uses, and creating real-word solutions.</li>
      </ul>
        This workshop is to gather researchers and practical users to open a collaborative platform for exchanging ideas, sharing pilot studies, and scoping future directions on this cutting-edge venue.
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p> </p>
      <h2>Workshop Topics</h2>

	    <h2>Programme</h2>
        <h5 align="left"><strong>1st Keynote: Scientometrics in the Era of Large Language Models</strong></h5>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: This keynote concerns the emergence of large language models, most recently and popularly embodied ChatGPT. These models have been trained using deep learning algorithms on a massive corpus of text data collected from sources across the web. These models demand a fundamental change in the conduct of scientometric research. In this speech I describe why I think such changes are necessary, and how such research changes may be enacted. </p>

        <h5 align="left"><strong>2nd Keynote: Large Language Models for Information Retrieval and Extraction</strong></h5>
        <p align="left"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large language models (LLMs) have changed AI and in many ways determine what AI is and can do. Though there have been many applications and uses of LLMs, we will discuss what LLMs mean for information retrieval and extraction. Already an LLM is used in Google ranking. How else can LLMs be used in these areas and what can and can’t they do.</p>

        <h2>Submission Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Regular papers</strong>: All submissions must be written in English, following the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Proceedings template</a> (10 pages for <strong>full papers</strong> and 4 pages for <strong>short papers</strong> exclusive of unlimited pages for references) and should be submitted as PDF files to <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=eeke-aii2023">EasyChair</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Poster &amp; demonstration</strong>: We welcome submissions     detailing original, early findings, works in progress and industrial     applications of knowledge entities extraction ande evaluation for a     special poster session, possibly with a 2-minute presentation in the     main session. Some research track papers will also be invited to the     poster track instead, although there will be no difference in the final     proceedings between poster and research track submissions. These   papers   should follow the same format as the research track papers but   can be   shorter (2 pages for <strong>poster and demo papers</strong>).</p>
        <h3> <span style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=eeke-aii2023" target="_new">Submit a paper</a></span></h3>
        <p> All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent  reviewers. <strong>Please   be aware of the fact that at least   one author per paper needs to   register for the workshop and   attend the workshop to present the work.</strong> In case of no-show   the paper (even if accepted) will be deleted from the   proceedings and from the program. </p>
        <p>Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop     proceedings publication service. This way the  proceedings will be   permanently available and citable (digital   persistent identifiers and   long term preservation).</p>
